I'm developing a TradingView indicator that displays strike prices on the right side of the chart, updating in real-time with the current price. 
The live site is still under development, and I'm still working on how I'll be integrating data feeds and other APIs with TradingView's charting library.
I aim to make this free indicator publicly available on the TradingView app before February 2024

On the image provided, I only drew the strike prices on the chart using the pine editor, the strike prices stay static and don't update with the current price change. 

If any other type of information is needed please let me know, thank you.
