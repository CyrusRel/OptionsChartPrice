I'm developing a TradingView indicator that displays strike prices on the right side of the chart, updating in real-time with the current price. 
The live site is still under development, and I'm still working on how I'll be integrating data feeds and other APIs with TradingView's charting library.
I aim to make this free indicator publicly available on the TradingView app before February 2024
